## Background
According to the CDC, 1 out of 12 people have Asthma. From researching the area of interactive computing and chronic care management, it has been proven that using information and communication technologies can improve health outcomes in addition to taking several factors into consideration. This app was created to address the social awareness factor for Asthma. Birthday Candles is an interactive social platform for people with and without Asthma to come together by creating and sharing birthday cakes.
